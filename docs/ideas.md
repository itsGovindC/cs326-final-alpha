# Innovation Idea
 Students often have a rough time deciding what foods to eat, and what's good in the dining halls. Sometimes being #1 Dining doesn't help with so many choices. So we decided to create an application that allows student to review the various food items being served at dining halls and elsewhere. It will be a space only for students, and allows UMass Dining to review and improve on the feedback. The Feedback will be publicly available. Students can view the food items for the day and relevant reviews on those items chronologically. We will also try to include nutritional data for those items. 
 
# Important Components
We will attempt to scrape data from the UMass Dining website either from an open source GitHub project or by ourselves. Once we have retrieved the Menu, we will store it on our server. Users will have access to a login/logout page. They will only be allowed to access the "Leave a Review page" if they have logged in. However, anyone can publicly view the feedback posted, and we will have a few filters, to allow users to sort reviews.
Reviews will require a food item and a dining hall as their unique identifiers. We will try to automate the nutrition labelling ourselves.
